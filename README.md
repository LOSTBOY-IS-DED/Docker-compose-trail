### **Docker Compose Learning Project** 🐳  

#### **Overview**  
This project is a simple assignment to understand and practice **Docker Compose**. We are learning how to define and manage multi-container applications using a `docker-compose.yml` file.  

#### **What We Are Doing?**  
- Setting up **Docker Compose** to manage multiple services.  
- Running containers for different services like a database and an application.  
- Using volumes and networks to enable communication between containers.  
- Learning how to start, stop, and remove containers efficiently.  

#### **Commands to Get Started**  
1. **Start the services:**  
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
2. **Check running containers:**  
   ```sh
   docker ps
   ```
3. **Stop and remove services:**  
   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   ```
4. **Remove unused volumes (if needed):**  
   ```sh
   docker volume prune -f
   ```

#### **Why Use Docker Compose?**  
- Simplifies container management.  
- Defines everything in a single YAML file.  
- Easily scales services up or down.  

This project is a hands-on way to get familiar with Docker Compose and container orchestration. 🚀
